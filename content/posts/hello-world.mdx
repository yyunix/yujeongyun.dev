NextJS is a **framework for ReactJS**.

Wait a second ... a "framework" for React? Isn't React itself already a framework for JavaScript?

Well ... first of all, React is a "library" for JavaScript. That seems to be important for some people.

Not for me, but still, there is a valid point: React already is a framework / library for JavaScript. So it's already an extra layer on top of JS.

## Why would we then need NextJS?

Because NextJS makes building React apps easier - especially React apps that should have server-side rendering (though it does way more than just take care of that).

In this article, we'll dive into the core concepts and features NextJS has to offer:

- File-based Routing
- Built-in Page Pre-rendering
- Rich Data Fetching Capabilities
- Image Optimization
- Much More

## File-based Routing

For `generate-sitemap.js`, I included the script in the webpack section of `next.config.js` to invoke the function when running `npm run build`. The script will generate a `sitemap.xml` in the `public/` directory.

```js fileName=toggle.jsx
export const Toggle = () => {
  const [isDark, setIsDark] = useDarkMode();

  return (
    <label>
      <input
        type="checkbox"
        checked={isDark}
        onChange={(e) => setIsDark(e.target.checked)}
      />
      Dark Mode
    </label>
  );
};
```

```js fileName=userDarkMode.js id=useDarkMode
export function useDarkMode() {
  const prefersDarkMode = __usePrefersDarkMode__();
  const [isEnabled, setIsEnabled] = __useSafeLocalStorage__(
    "dark-mode",
    undefined
  );

  const enabled = isEnabled === undefined ? prefersDarkMode : isEnabled;

  useEffect(() => {
    if (window === undefined) return;
    const root = window.document.documentElement;
    root.classList.remove(enabled ? "light" : "dark");
    root.classList.add(enabled ? "dark" : "light");
  }, [enabled]);

  return [enabled, setIsEnabled];
}
```
