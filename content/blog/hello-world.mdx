NextJS is a **framework for ReactJS**.

Wait a second ... a "framework" for React? Isn't React itself already a framework for JavaScript?

Well ... first of all, React is a "library" for JavaScript. That seems to be important for some people.

Not for me, but still, there is a valid point: React already is a framework / library for JavaScript. So it's already an extra layer on top of JS.

## Why would we then need NextJS?

Because NextJS makes building React apps easier - especially React apps that should have server-side rendering (though it does way more than just take care of that).

In this article, we'll dive into the core concepts and features NextJS has to offer:

- File-based Routing
- Built-in Page Pre-rendering
- Rich Data Fetching Capabilities
- Image Optimization
- Much More

## File-based Routing

For `generate-sitemap.js`, I included the script in the webpack section of `next.config.js` to invoke the function when running `npm run build`. The script will generate a `sitemap.xml` in the `public/` directory.

```js fileName=toggle.jsx
export const Toggle = () => {
  const [isDark, setIsDark] = useDarkMode();

  return (
    <label>
      <input
        type="checkbox"
        checked={isDark}
        onChange={(e) => setIsDark(e.target.checked)}
      />
      Dark Mode
    </label>
  );
};
```

```html
<html>
  <body></body>
</html>
```

```css fileName=index.css
:root {
  @apply .light;
}

.dark {
  --color-bg-primary: #2d3748;
  --color-bg-secondary: #283141;
  --color-text-primary: #f7fafc;
  --color-text-secondary: #e2e8f0;
  --color-text-accent: #81e6d9;
}

.light {
  --color-bg-primary: #ffffff;
  --color-bg-secondary: #edf2f7;
  --color-text-primary: #2d3748;
  --color-text-secondary: #4a5568;
  --color-text-accent: #2b6cb0;
}

@import "tailwindcss/base";
@import "tailwindcss/components";
@import "tailwindcss/utilities";
```
