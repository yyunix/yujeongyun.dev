Odd svg error on the browser due to hydration mismatch.
We cannot know the theme on the server, the values returned from `useTheme` will be `undefined` until mounted on the client side. This results in our theme icon not matching the actual current theme.

Solution is to make sure we only render our icon when the page is mounted on the client.

## Why would we then need NextJS?

Because NextJS makes building React apps easier - especially React apps that should have server-side rendering (though it does way more than just take care of that).

In this article, we'll dive into the core concepts and features NextJS has to offer:

- File-based Routing
- Built-in Page Pre-rendering
- Rich Data Fetching Capabilities
- Image Optimization
- Much More

## File-based Routing

For `generate-sitemap.js`, I included the script in the webpack section of `next.config.js` to invoke the function when running `npm run build`. The script will generate a `sitemap.xml` in the `public/` directory.

```js fileName=toggle.jsx
export const Toggle = () => {
  const [isDark, setIsDark] = useDarkMode();

  return (
    <label>
      <input
        type="checkbox"
        checked={isDark}
        onChange={(e) => setIsDark(e.target.checked)}
      />
      Dark Mode
    </label>
  );
};
```

```html
<html>
  <body></body>
</html>
```

```css fileName=index.css
:root {
  @apply .light;
}

.dark {
  --color-bg-primary: #2d3748;
  --color-bg-secondary: #283141;
  --color-text-primary: #f7fafc;
  --color-text-secondary: #e2e8f0;
  --color-text-accent: #81e6d9;
}

.light {
  --color-bg-primary: #ffffff;
  --color-bg-secondary: #edf2f7;
  --color-text-primary: #2d3748;
  --color-text-secondary: #4a5568;
  --color-text-accent: #2b6cb0;
}

@import "tailwindcss/base";
@import "tailwindcss/components";
@import "tailwindcss/utilities";
```
