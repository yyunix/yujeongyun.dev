description: Clean up your import statements by using alias imports with Craco

I like to have my import statements all neat and organized. I do not like '../../' everywhere like the screent shot shown below.

A solution to implementing alias imports is not as straight forward as one might imagine when a project is bootstrapped with Create React App.

Here is a solution I found without having to eject and override the Webpack configuration. I used a third party library called Craco.

### Step 1: Start a CRA project with TypeScript template

```bash
npx create-react-app my-app --template typescript
```

### Step 2: Update your tsconfig.json

Add `baseUrl` and `paths`

```json fileName=tsconfig.json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    // ...
    "baseUrl": "./src",
    "paths": {
      "@assets/*": ["assets/*"],
      "@components/*": ["components/*"],
      "@hooks/*": ["hooks/*"],
      "@pages/*": ["pages/*"],
      "@store/*": ["store/*"],
      "@style/*": ["style/*"],
      "@type/*": ["types/*"],
      "@utils/*": ["utils/*"]
      // Modify as you wish
    }
  }
  // ...
}
```

### Step 3: In your terminal, download Craco

As of October 4, 2022, for whatever reason, I couldn't make it work with `npm i @craco/craco`. So I used an alpha version.

```bash
npm i @craco/craco@7.0.0-alpha.7
```

### Step 4: Modify Webpack settings with Craco

Create `craco.config.js` in the root directory

```js fileName=craco.config.js
const path = require(`path`);

module.exports = {
  webpack: {
    alias: {
      "@assets": path.resolve(__dirname, "src/assets"),
      "@components": path.resolve(__dirname, "src/components"),
      "@hooks": path.resolve(__dirname, "src/hooks"),
      "@pages": path.resolve(__dirname, "src/pages"),
      "@store": path.resolve(__dirname, "src/store"),
      "@style": path.resolve(__dirname, "src/style"),
      "@type": path.resolve(__dirname, "src/types"),
      "@utils": path.resolve(__dirname, "src/utils"),
      // Modify as you wish
    },
  },
};
```

Update package.json

```json fileName=package.json
"scripts": {
  "start": "craco start",
  "build": "craco build",
  // ...
},
"cracoConfig": "craco.config.js"
```

That's it! All the required configuration is done and you can now use new alias imports.

If you'd like to see a live project with these exact same configuration [see this Git repo of Kanban app](https://github.com/yjcyun/kanban-app)
